I'm there. Also I'm dead tired that day from teaching and I will be sounding like a seal singing Kiss from a Rose. Speaking of which, how about a duet or group project with that song?</p> <p>This is your time. You will join us and then afterwards sit back at home and muse "I sang, I danced, I dined maybe, and definitely spread pure joy across the room with my rendition of (i.e. Livin' On A Prayer)."</p> <p>You will do this, you can do this, consider it done!</p> <p><a href="https://encorekaraokesf.com/songbook" class="linkified">https://encorekaraokesf.com/songbook</a></p> <p>Greetings fab super awesome spiffy strong Karaoke Person!

"description": "<p>Venue details follow Artist Info</p> <p>ARTIST INFO<br/>Paul Sprawl has enjoyed a full-time music career since Sept. 1997. He plays all over North America and in Europe. He has nine full-length recordings of his own songs (to date), the first on a German label and the others independently produced. He's also produced three full-length CDs for other artists.</p> <p>Born and raised in California, he and his wife are currently building a place for artists to find refuge and inspiration in Big Bend, Texas. Playing guitar, singing and writing songs since he was a boy, his music uniquely combines percussive (hammer) guitar techniques with bottleneck, tapping, harmonica, and a rich baritone voice.</p> <p>Whether documentaries of real world characters met traveling, flights of guitar fascination, or detailed cinematic inspiration, Sprawl's songs come from a lifelong far, wide, and deep creative process. His sensibility is that of a world traveler grown from a kid schooled in Southern California in the 60's and 70's film and music culture. The scope of his songwriting breaks barriers with a complex, intricate, sound linking our humanity with his thoughtfully crafted lyrics. He gives voice to outsiders of the world and captures full, intimate moments with his poetic (yet incisive) style.</p> <p>More info and links to music at...<br/><a href="https://www.ListeningRoomNetwork.com/event-acampbell20180519.html" class="linkified">https://www.ListeningRoomNetwork.com/event-acampbell20180519.html</a></p> <p>VENUE DETAILS<br/>~ RSVPs confirmed/waitlist closed 2 days before the event.<br/>~ Address provided to confirmed guests prior to the show.<br/>(Menlo Park, Willows neighborhood)<br/>Gate opens at 6:30pm; seating is first-come, first choice.<br/>There's an organic garden to explore after you've chosen your seat.<br/>Wear layers for comfort (RAIN moves Garden gigs into the Cottage).<br/>~ A suggested $15 donation will be collected at the door.<br/>~ Dala's Nest is nestled among heritage oaks and redwoods and is hidden<br/>from the street; look for venue signs posted just before door/gate time.<br/>~ ABUNDANT, free, street parking (DRIVEWAY is a FIRELANE - do not use).<br/>~ If you like, BYOB/snacks.

"description": "<p>An evening of jazz and blues, with a sprinkling of bluegrass and wild gypsy music from Dirty Cello. Special guest performance by Jazz vocalist Lisa Lindsley.<br/>From China to Italy, and all over the USA, Dirty Cello brings the world a high energy and unique spin on blues and bluegrass. Led by vivacious cross-over cellist Rebecca Roudman, Dirty Cello is cello like you’ve never heard before. From down home blues with a wailing cello to virtuosic stompin’ bluegrass, Dirty Cello is a band that gets your heart thumping and your toes tapping!<br/>Oakland-based jazz vocalist Lisa Lindsley has been called a glass of champagne, cool, refreshing, and a little bubbly. Living and creating on two continents, America and Europe, is not always easy, but is always fun. Lindsley invites listeners to surrender to her smoky soprano, while her vocal command and deft timing assure they will be delighted they did.</p> <p>Tickets available: <a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3334927" class="linkified">https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3334927</a></p> ",
